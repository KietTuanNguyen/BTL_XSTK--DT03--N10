```{r}
# Read file CSV
X_train <- read.csv("../Data/X_train.csv")
Y_train <- read.csv("../Data/Y_train.csv", header = TRUE)$Condition  # Ensure Y_train is read as a vector
X_test <- read.csv("../Data/X_test.csv")
Y_test <- read.csv("../Data/Y_test.csv", header = TRUE)$Condition  # Ensure Y_test is read as a vector

# Convert Y_train as_factor
if (!is.factor(Y_train)) {
  Y_train <- as.factor(Y_train)
}
```

```{r}
# Load the nnet library for softmax regression
library(nnet)

# Ensure that "2" is one of the levels in Y_train$Condition
levels(Y_train) <- c(levels(Y_train), "2")

# Relevel Y_train$Condition
Y_train <- relevel(Y_train, ref = "2")


# Train softmax regression model
softmax_model <- multinom(Y_train ~ ., data = X_train)

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```{r}
# 2-tailed z test
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1)) * 2
p
```
```{r}
p < 0.05
```
```{r}
## extract the coefficients from the model and exponentiate
exp(coef(softmax_model))

```{r}

```{r}


# Predictions on test set

# Calculate accuracy
